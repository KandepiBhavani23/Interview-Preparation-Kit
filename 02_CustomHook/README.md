**Create a Custom Hook called useFetch that accepts a URL**

**[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](<[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users]()>) and returns the fetched data, loading state and any error that occurred during the fetch operation.**

**Use useEffect and useState in your implementation.**
